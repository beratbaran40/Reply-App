##  Features

- **Adaptive UI Layouts**  
  Responsive design using `WindowSizeClass` to adapt between phone, tablet, and foldable screens.
- **Multiple Navigation Patterns**  
  Compact layouts use bottom navigation, while expanded screens switch to navigation rail or side drawer.
- **Material 3 Theming**  
  Implements M3 theming, including primary-container and on-primary-container for emphasized UI states.
- **Clean, Compose-Only Implementation**  
  Built entirely with Jetpack Compose — no fragments or XML needed.
